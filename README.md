# activityAnalysis

###I just have one script "run_analysis.R" and  follow the steps below  ###
        1. set the working directory and download the data  
        2. get the train data and test data  with subject labels and activity labels  
        3. get the feture names and activity labels(names), which will be used after  
        4. merge the train and test data and give them describtive column names  
        5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
        6.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
        7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each   variable for each activity and each subject.
